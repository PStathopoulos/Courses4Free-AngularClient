# Courses4Free Angular Client
An Angular Client for consuming Courses4Free RESTful API
----------------------------------------------------------
A Client designed and developed in Angular (Javascript Framework, depends on Typescript) in order to consume the Courses RESTful API (developed on JAVA EE Platform). It provides a User Interface for displaying contents of and interacting with a database, which contains courses, teachers and students of those courses. HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap Framework also included in the construction of the whole work.

This is an early version of the Client, which has implementation for fetching the courses from the RESTful API Backend.
Later, modules like Authorization will be added to an updated version of the project.

This Project developed with Angular CLI, Atom Editor and npm (node.js package manager). 

In cmd, type npm install in order to install the missing node modules folder (that wasn't added to the project because of its size)
and npm start to run the project (notice that the backend project is deployed locally in Payara Application Server and therefore can't be accessed).
